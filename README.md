# Google-Playstore-Dataset-Analysis-in-Excel
Used the Google Play Store Apps Dataset by Ms. Lavanya Gupta (available on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) to predict the success of an app, given its category and user-rating.

As a part of my academic project, I chose this DataSet from Kaggle. It was scrapped using JQuery and was published by Ms. Lavanya Gupta.
It contains the following fields:
  APP – The name of the app.
  CATEGORY – Name of the Category to which, the app belongs, viz Family, Communications, Health, Investments, Beauty, and Games etc.
  RATING – Displays the average rating of the app on Playstore.
  REVIEWS – The count of total number of Reviews that the app has received on playstore.
  INSTALLS – The count of total number of installs.
  TYPE – Type of the App, Paid or Free.
  PRICE – The Price of the app on Playstore.
  CONTENT RATING – The content of the app is rated as per the titles like Everyone, Teens, 13+ or Adults, based on the content.
  GENRE – The genre to which the app belongs.
	
As recommended in our course-work, I used Tableau Prepbuilder to clean the Data. After the Preprocessing,
I used excel to analyse the data and draw out some fruitful conclusions:
It was infered that the success of an app depends largely on it's category (genre) and it's design.
Some categories outperform other categories! To strengthen my hypothesis, I showed my analysis using a dashboard.
Further, I also suggest the genre to guarantee success and the methods that would certainly escalate the growth of an app!

The Work is free to be reused, edited, republished for all academic and commercial purposes! Giving credits would be highly appreciated! :)

Here are a few Screen Captures of the dashboards:
